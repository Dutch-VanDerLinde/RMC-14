    The ship AI aboard your stationed ship has informed us that a distress has been picked up from the colony on LV-686, and that a mission is being prepared to investigate the disturbance.

    As such, the special services division has prepared a briefing on the nature of the colony, and known potential threats to its operation.

    Classified materials are excluded from this briefing and should be requested separately, and as such, the contents of this document may be shared or withheld at your discretion,
    unless otherwise specified.

    Discovered in 2097, the planet Dykuma I, also known as LV-686, was originally marked by geological survey as a potentially terraformable desert planet, was later found to be abundantly rich in underground aquifers of exceptionally high purity, and as such an independent core colony began colonization efforts in the 2100s.

    Shortly after the colonization efforts began, a hostile takeover by the Canadian Space Affairs Ministry in 2105 brought the colony under new ownership, soon sold to the Weston-Yamada Corporation, where in 2165 it began operations as a bottling plant under the [italic]Weyland Spring[/italic] brand.

    As the demand for spring water and the size of the colony's operations both have grown, the deposits of drinking water at the original site for the colony have dried up, and as such the sprawl has continued to expand outwards, ever in search of more deposits to tap.

    With an estimated 2500 colonists, the refinery has become a bustling town, and the number one provider of drinkable water in the Neroid Sector and surrounding space, as well as a significant supplier for the [italic]Weyland Spring[/italic] brand.

    The number one priority is that any operation on the site of Weyland Spring Bottling Center No. 8 does not employ chemical weapons or otherwise risk contaminating the groundwater supply and aquifers below. The use of lead and depleted uranium bullets should be avoided.

    Additionally, the colony’s water treatment plant contains large stockpiles of chemicals that may be hazardous in unapproved amounts. Damage to the tanks storing these chemicals must be mitigated.

    The Kutjevo facility contains only a token Colonial Marshals Bureau, staffing roughly 2–6 members, and is primarily secured by corporate personnel. While the security garrison is relatively undersized for a colony of this size, division analysts believe corporate espionage is unlikely due to a variety of factors. After reviewing the data, analysts believe these are the most likely causes for the automated distress beacon, from most to least likely:

    - Geological activity (e.g. earthquakes or land-shift due to the drained aquifers beneath the site)
    - Maintenance failure of the colony's communications equipment
    - Failure to send the weekly "All-Clear" signal, resulting in an automated distress dispatch
    - Sabotage by the "Colonial Liberation Front"
    - A solar flare from the Dykuma star causing electrical failures
